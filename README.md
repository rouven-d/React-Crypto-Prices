## Overview

Displaying six currencies and their current prices updated in a 10sec interval: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Ripple, Cardano and Stellar. Simple Design using Boostrap for React.

### The challenge

Creating a simple card design that automatically adjusts to the amount of currencies entered into the API call. Updating the React state every 10 seconds with updated data via the API. Displaying an animated loader until the data is fetched according to it's interval.

### Next steps

Could further build out the application to let the user decide which crypto currencies to display by adjusting the API call dynamically. Could also learn to enable websockets for real time data management.

### Built with

- React
- Coingecko API
